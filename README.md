A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and background sync and have ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programmatically managing a cache of responses.

In the future, service workers might support other things like periodic sync or geofencing.

A service worker is a background worker that acts as a programmable proxy, allowing us to control what happens on a request-by-request basis. We can use it to make (parts of, or even entire) React apps work offline
